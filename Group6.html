                            The cost of getting electicity is highlighted for a select group of countries, and is indicative of the cost associated
                            with ensuring permanent energy supply for a new business in each nation states.

                            <br>
                            This cost has traditionally been substantially higher in China relative to both
                            other developed nation states such as the United States developing
                            countries such as India.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After China, the cost of getting electricity is the highest in the United Kingdom (relative to the other countries in this analysis).

                            The cost of getting electricty in the United Kingdom has reduced in recent years, with
                            a substantial decrease from 2014 onwards, though it is still higher than that of 
                            certain developed and developing nation states, like the United States and India respectively.

                            Inflation is a cost of living indicator as it can be used
                            to assess the impact of increases on the affordability of energy.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Higher inflation rates may indicate that energy price increases aren't as substantial as they may appear to be.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Likewise, a low level of inflation, indicates a lower year on year effect of energy price rises i.e., even if energy prices
                            increase the affordability of energy may not significantly reduce.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Certain developed economies, such as the United States and China witnessed deflation or a decrease
                            in year on year prices in 2009 (in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis), this can largely be attributed to
                            associated economic slowdowns and contractions.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Inflation rates have traditionally been substantially higher for
                            developing economies such as India, relative to more developed
                            nation states such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The inflation rate for India (which is characterised as a developing economy) has greatly reduced and has come closer in
                            line with that of more developed countries in recent years, this indicates that affordability of energy supply may be less 
                            affected by energy cost increases, relative to previous years.

                Historically, the UK was heavily reliant on fossil fuel energy. In 1965, the energy mix was heavily dominated by crude oil and coal consumption.
                <br> <br>
                The gradual phasing out of coal consumption has led to increasing reliance on natural gas. However, investment in renewable energy has helped diversify the energy mix in recent years.
                <br> <br>
                Although nuclear energy has had a consistent contribution to the energy mix, the rapid growth of wind consumption can be explained by the focus of renewable investment in wind infrastructure.
                <br> <br>
                Additionally, through observing the funnelling effect of the plot in more recent years, it’s evident that the overall energy consumption in the UK has slightly reduced since around the year of 2000.
                <br> <br>
                A combination of reducing energy consumption and investment in renewable energy technology, has allowed for the rapidly growing contributions by renewable energy. However, the current energy mix is still heavily dominated by oil and gas.

                To understand how susceptible UK energy prices are affected by global events and policies, it’s worth discerning the quantity of the energy mix that is formed of imported energy. That is to say, how self-reliant is the UK when it comes to energy?
                <br> <br>
                Year on year variation of import contributions suggests that imports play an important part in dealing with sudden changes in demand.
                <br> <br>
                Taking a longer term view, import contributions fluctuate significantly decade to decade. High import reliance in the 1970s switched to the UK becoming a net exporter during the 1980s and 90s due to development in the North Sea.
                <br> <br>
                Imports reliance increased at the turn of the century, but through the growth in wind production has begun to decrease again.
                <br> <br>
                Over the last decade, on average 35% of annual energy consumption is formed of imported energy. With such a significant part of the energy mix formed of imports, the UK is affected by international politics, prices and shortages.

            <div id="int_import_dependency"></div>
            <text style="text-align:left; font: 'Lato';font-size: 16px; position:absolute; left:998px; right:20px; top:130px;">
                How does the UK’s import dependency compare to other countries?
                <br> <br>
                Considering the last two decades, the UK’s import dependency presents significantly larger variation than the other case study countries. In particular, the UKs switch from a being net exporter to one of the largest energy importers is unique.
                <br> <br>
                As established earlier, energy consumption has fallen in recent years. In context, the UK’s increasing reliance on imports until 2013 is peculiar. It suggest that despite energy consumption falling, instead of reducing imports, the UK has reduced internal energy production.
                <br> <br>
                India and China demonstrate a progressively rising reliance on imported energy. This is likely due to their rapid economic development with demand outstripping the rate of development of internal energy production infrastructure.
                <br> <br>
                Germany has a uniquely high and consistent reliance on imports indicating the dependency the country has on international trends and events. The USA has slowly reduced its import reliance and only recently become a net exporter.
                <br> <br>
                The UK’s reliance on imported energy is comparatively high against other case study countries, but where does this imported energy come from?

                What energy types is the UK importing, and where is it coming from?
                <br> <br>
                Since 2001, imported energy types have diversified largely through the growth of dominance of oil imports and phasing out of coal.
                <br> <br>
                The two main imported energy types of Oil and Gas are dominated by supplies from Norway, demonstrating a significant reliance. In 2001, Norway supplied around 75% of all oil and gas imports to the UK.
                <br> <br>
                The diversification of suppliers in recent years is largely due to the U.S.A. becoming a net exporter and supplying the UK with about 25% of oil consumption and 11% of gas consumption.

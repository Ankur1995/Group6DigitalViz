                            Inflation is a cost of living indicator as it can be used
                            to assess the impact of increases on the affordability of energy.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Higher inflation rates may indicate that energy price increases aren't as substantial as
                            they may appear to be.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Likewise, a low level of inflation, indicates a lower year on year effect of energy price
                            rises i.e., even if energy prices
                            increase the affordability of energy may not significantly reduce.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Certain developed economies, such as the United States and China witnessed deflation or a
                            decrease
                            in year on year prices in 2009 (in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis), this can
                            largely be attributed to
                            associated economic slowdowns and contractions.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Inflation rates have traditionally been substantially higher for
                            developing economies such as India, relative to more developed
                            nation states such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The inflation rate for India (which is characterised as a developing economy) has greatly
                            reduced and has come closer in
                            line with that of more developed countries in recent years, this indicates that
                            affordability of energy supply may be less
                            affected by energy cost increases, relative to previous years.

                Historically, the UK was heavily reliant on fossil fuel energy. In 1965, the energy mix was heavily
                dominated by crude oil and coal consumption.
                <br> <br>
                The gradual phasing out of coal consumption has led to increasing reliance on natural gas. However,
                investment in renewable energy has helped diversify the energy mix in recent years.
                <br> <br>
                Although nuclear energy has had a consistent contribution to the energy mix, the rapid growth of wind
                consumption can be explained by the focus of renewable investment in wind infrastructure.
                <br> <br>
                Additionally, through observing the funnelling effect of the plot in more recent years, it’s evident
                that the overall energy consumption in the UK has slightly reduced since around the year of 2000.
                <br> <br>
                A combination of reducing energy consumption and investment in renewable energy technology, has allowed
                for the rapidly growing contributions by renewable energy. However, the current energy mix is still
                heavily dominated by oil and gas.

                To understand how susceptible UK energy prices are affected by global events and policies, it’s worth
                discerning the quantity of the energy mix that is formed of imported energy. That is to say, how
                self-reliant is the UK when it comes to energy?
                <br> <br>
                Year on year variation of import contributions suggests that imports play an important part in dealing
                with sudden changes in demand.
                <br> <br>
                Taking a longer term view, import contributions fluctuate significantly decade to decade. High import
                reliance in the 1970s switched to the UK becoming a net exporter during the 1980s and 90s due to
                development in the North Sea.
                <br> <br>
                Imports reliance increased at the turn of the century, but through the growth in wind production has
                begun to decrease again.
                <br> <br>
                Over the last decade, on average 35% of annual energy consumption is formed of imported energy. With
                such a significant part of the energy mix formed of imports, the UK is affected by international
                politics, prices and shortages.

                How does the UK’s import dependency compare to other countries?
                <br> <br>
                Considering the last two decades, the UK’s import dependency presents significantly larger variation
                than the other case study countries. In particular, the UKs switch from a being net exporter to one of
                the largest energy importers is unique.
                <br> <br>
                As established earlier, energy consumption has fallen in recent years. In context, the UK’s increasing
                reliance on imports until 2013 is peculiar. It suggest that despite energy consumption falling, instead
                of reducing imports, the UK has reduced internal energy production.
                <br> <br>
                India and China demonstrate a progressively rising reliance on imported energy. This is likely due to
                their rapid economic development with demand outstripping the rate of development of internal energy
                production infrastructure.
                <br> <br>
                Germany has a uniquely high and consistent reliance on imports indicating the dependency the country has
                on international trends and events. The USA has slowly reduced its import reliance and only recently
                become a net exporter.
                <br> <br>
                The UK’s reliance on imported energy is comparatively high against other case study countries, but where
                does this imported energy come from?

                What energy types is the UK importing, and where is it coming from?
                <br> <br>
                Since 2001, imported energy types have diversified largely through the growth of dominance of oil
                imports and phasing out of coal.
                <br> <br>
                The two main imported energy types of Oil and Gas are dominated by supplies from Norway, demonstrating a
                significant reliance. In 2001, Norway supplied around 75% of all oil and gas imports to the UK.
                <br> <br>
                The diversification of suppliers in recent years is largely due to the U.S.A. becoming a net exporter
                and supplying the UK with about 25% of oil consumption and 11% of gas consumption.

                When we look at total energy consumption, differences across countries often reflect differences in
                population size: countries with lots of people inevitably consume more energy than tiny countries.
                <br> <br>
                How do countries compare when we look at energy consumption per person?
                <br> <br>
                This interactive chart shows per capita energy consumption. We see vast differences across the world.

                The largest energy consumers include Iceland, Norway, Canada, the United States, and wealthy nations in
                the Middle East such as Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The average person in these countries consumes as
                much as 100 times more than the average person in some of the poorest countries.
                <br> <br>
                In fact, the true differences between the richest and poorest might be even greater. We do not have
                high-quality data on energy consumption for many of the world’s poorest countries. This is because they
                often use very little commercially-traded energy sources (such as coal, oil, gas, or grid electricity)
                and instead rely on traditional biomass – crop residues, wood and other organic matter that is difficult
                to quantify. This means we often lack good data on energy consumption for the world’s poorest.

                Next we focus on four representative countries: the United States, India, the United Kingdom, and China.
                <br> <br>
                The U.S. average energy use per person remained steady overall during the 1990-2020 period, but there
                were two more significant decreases in 2004-2012 and after 2018, respectively, and it was found that
                both decreases were due to industrial upgrading and expanding the use of new energy sources.
                <br> <br>
                Although nuclear energy has had a consistent contribution to the energy mix, the rapid growth of wind
                consumption can be explained by the focus of renewable investment in wind infrastructure.
                <br> <br>
                India as a whole shows a smooth upward trend, also with the smooth development of the country.
                <br> <br>
                The UK has two decreasing trends overall after 2006, similar to the United States, respectively, after
                2006-2011 and 2018, for reasons similar to the United States, industrial upgrading, and the expanded use
                of new energy, where the second decline should be due to the expanded use of new energy after joining
                the Paris Agreement.
                <br> <br>
                China has shown a rapid rise in the overall trend during the 30 years, especially after 2002, and the
                initial exploration may be due to the rapid development of manufacturing after joining the WTO.
                <br> <br>
                Overall, average energy use per person is much higher in developed countries than in developing
                countries, but while it is declining in developed countries, it is rising in developing countries.

                Energy and Growth: New Trends
                <br> <br>
                Since the industrial revolution, energy availability has enabled economic growth. The norm was to
                expect economic growth to always align with increasing energy use and energy needs.
                <br> <br>
                However, recent decades have shown that it is possible to decouple economic growth and energy use. A
                number of developed countries such as Germany, UK, and USA have experienced this, while fast-growing
                nations such as China and India sustain energy demands with GDP growth.
                <br> <br>
                We may question if decoupling is an artefact of offshoring production, since developed countries
                (net importers of embodied energy) export energy-intensive industrial processes to developing
                countries (net exporters of embodied energy).
                <br> <br>
                But we know the decoupling is valid because supporting metrics are trade-adjusted. The metric of
                consumption-based energy use is equal to domestic energy use, with the energy used to produce
                exports removed, and the energy used to produce imports added.

                Energy and Growth: Driving Factors
                <br> <br>
                Countries are replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon energy; as these renewable energy technologies
                progress in their learning curves, they become more affordable compared to nonrenewable resources.
                <br> <br>
                Service economies require less energy use. Fast-growing countries such as India and China are also
                shifting from industrial to service economies.
                <br> <br>
                The world is seeing increased electrification, which is intrinsically more energy efficient.
                <br> <br>
                Overall developments in technology and behaviour improve energy efficiency.

                <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.25em;">Policies are classified by the policy tracker under
                    'clean conditional' if they state support away from fossil fuels, but are not necessarily
                    specific
                    regarding the implementation of appropriate sustainable counterparts. 'Clean Unconditional'
                    refers
                    to potentially clean clean, sustainable policies that are in support of
                    production or consumption of energy in a low-carbon process having negligible effect on the
                    environment. 'Fossil Condition' are policies that support the production and consumption of
                    fossil fuels (oil, gas, coal, or fossil fuel based electricity). 'Fossil Unconditional' are
                    policies
                    that support production and consumption of fossil fuels without any
                    sustainability targets. 'Other Energy' are policies outside the above but falling under an
                    umbrella
                    cateogy (such as nuclear power, uranium mining).</p>
                <p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.25em;">The graph displays that investments towards energy
                    has
                    been more in 2020 than the two consecutive years.
                    Although, 'clean conditional' (individually) shows an upward trend in 2022 and 'other energy'
                    has
                    garnered much investment in 2021; the overall
                    trend is downwards.</p>
